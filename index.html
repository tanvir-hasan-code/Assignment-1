                        A key aspect of Bangladesh 2.0 is the development of a thriving digital economy. This includes fostering e-commerce, digital banking, online education, telemedicine, and more. Digital platforms are expected to provide new opportunities for entrepreneurs, small businesses, and startups, contributing to job creation and economic diversification. The government is keen to promote digital payment systems and fintech innovations to ease financial transactions and improve financial inclusion across the country.In Bangladesh 2.0, cities are envisioned as smart and sustainable hubs powered by technology. Smart cities would use technology to improve urban infrastructure, reduce traffic congestion, manage waste, and promote energy efficiency.
